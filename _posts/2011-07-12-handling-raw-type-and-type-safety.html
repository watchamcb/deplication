The addition of generics to Java 5 enabled type checking at compile time. This assists in preventing a ClassCastException at runtime but to maintain backward compatibility generics also came with <a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/generics/erasure.html%22">Type Erasure</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Type erasure exists so that new code may continue to interface with legacy code. Using a raw type for any other reason is considered bad programming practice and should be avoided whenever possible.<br />
<br />
When mixing legacy code with generic code, you may encounter warning messages similar to the following:<br />
<br />
Note: WarningDemo.java uses unchecked or unsafe operations.<br />
Note: Recompile with -Xlint:unchecked for details.</blockquote><br />
Unfortunately for projects with large legacy code bases or dependencies on legacy third party libraries the raw type warnings can be a major irritation if you prefer not to have false-positive warnings. The solution is to add the @SuppressWarnings("rawtypes") annotation which works as expected, telling the compiler to ignore the raw type issue. The problem with this approach (as <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1130433/how-to-avoid-unchecked-conversion-warning-in-java-if-you-use-legacy-libraries">discussed</a> elsewhere) is that your code ends up having an annotation for each call to the legacy code which in turn reduces readability. Adding @SuppressWarnings({ "unchecked", "rawtypes" }) at the class level will also suppress all the warnings but may unintentionally mask instances that should be flagged as warnings. An alternative approach is provided below.<br />
<br />
Lets assume that you have a legacy code method (which you are not able to change) as defined below:<br />
<pre class="brush: java">/**
     * Retrieve the list of values
     * @return A vector of string values
     */
    public static Vector getValues();
</pre><br />
In your code you would like to use generics to process the returned vector as below:<br />
<pre class="brush: java">public static void main(String[] args) {
        Vector&lt;String&gt; safeVector = getValues();
        for (String value : safeVector) {
            System.out.println(value);
        }
    }
</pre><br />
Compiling your code gives the "uses unchecked or unsafe operations" warning. Rather than adding the suppress warnings to every line where getValues() is being called you can instead define a wrapper method returning the typed vector as below:<br />
<pre class="brush: java">@SuppressWarnings({ "unchecked", "rawtypes" })
    public static &lt;T&gt; Vector&lt;T&gt; castType(Vector v) {
        return (Vector&lt;T&gt;) v;        
    }
</pre><br />
This means your code is changed as follows:<br />
<pre class="brush: java">public static void main(String[] args) {
        Vector&lt;String&gt; safeVector = castType(getValues());
        for (String value : safeVector) {
            System.out.println(value);
        }
    }
</pre><br />
The warning messages are no longer a problem and the code functions as expected. A few notes on the implementation:<br />
<br />
<ul><li>The type T is inferred from the Vector&lt;String&gt; declaration, the castType method would work equally well for an integer vector (Vector&lt;Integer&gt;) .</li>
<li>The warning is merely being suppressed, the castType method is not actually checking the type of the vector elements. A runtime exception will occur when accessing an element if the vector passed to the method is not actually of the declared type.</li>
<li>The castType method should only be used when you are certain of the type of elements contained in the vector (restating the above point).</li>
<li>The castType implementation is using vectors to demonstrate the concept but can be extended to other types (or even generalised to use the Collection interface)</li>
<li>An argument can be made against the overhead of castType method call instead of a class level @SuppressWarnings annotation, this implementation merely provides an alternative.</li>
</ul><br />
For completeness the generalised method would look as follows:<br />
<pre class="brush: java">@SuppressWarnings({ "unchecked", "rawtypes" })
    public static &lt;T&gt; Collection&lt;T&gt; castType(Collection v) {
        return (Collection&lt;T&gt;) v;        
    }
</pre>
