<p>EC2 instances launched by Auto Scaling really should not be terminated outside of Auto Scaling but if for some reason
you (really, really) need to terminate a number of instances you may see some unexpected behaviour if you terminate them
using the EC2 console. Instead of all the instances being replaced by Auto Scaling simultaneously they are replaced
individually over a period of time. This means that it may take significantly longer than you would expect to get the
ASG back to the original size. As an <a href="https://gist.github.com/watchamcb/fc686c70e8c2660ee7ef"
    target="_blank">example</a>&nbsp;an instance in my test ASG was replaced every 2 minutes, taking around 6 minutes to
terminate and replace 3 instances.</p>

<br />
There are two ways of doing this more efficiently (using the supremely useful <a
    href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/index.html" target="_blank">AWS CLI</a>), firstly by setting the group
capacity and then resetting it:<br />
<br />

Note that&nbsp;<a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/autoscaling/update-auto-scaling-group.html"
    target="_blank">update-auto-scaling-group</a>&nbsp;is used due to the minimum size being set, if no minimum size is
specified the same result can be achieved with&nbsp;<a
    href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/autoscaling/set-desired-capacity.html"
    target="_blank">set-desired-capacity</a>.<br />
<br />
The second option is to use&nbsp;<a
    href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/autoscaling/terminate-instance-in-auto-scaling-group.html"
    target="_blank">terminate-instance-in-auto-scaling-group</a>:<br />
