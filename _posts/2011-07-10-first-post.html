The purpose of this blog is to share information I have found to be useful. Some of the information may be available elsewhere on the net but possibly not in the context it is presented here. The idea for this blog was realised (UK spelling) when considering the focus on consuming and sharing existing information rather than producing potentially original content.<br />
<br />
Given my focus on technology, and more specifically software development, a lot of the posts are likely to have technical content. There is no shortage of arbitrary sharing of inane daily information on the net and while this can be amusing, for the most part it is merely narcissistic and transient. As with all things, I expect the nature of this blog to change over time, hopefully improving as it changes.
