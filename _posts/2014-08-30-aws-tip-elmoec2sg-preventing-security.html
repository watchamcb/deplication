<span>If you are trying to delete an EC2 security group and get an error something like:</span><br />
<span><br /></span>
<span id="caseCorrespondence_27243625145_text">sg-12345678: Group 111222333444:My SG Name is used by groups: 123412341234:elmo.ec2sg.887766</span><br />
<span><br /></span>
<span>Save yourself some time and check that your ElastiCache and RDS security groups don't reference (by name) the group you are trying to delete.&nbsp;</span>See <a href="https://forums.aws.amazon.com/thread.jspa?messageID=555154" target="_blank">this</a>&nbsp;forum thread.
