Trick for the day. Adding the Maven Shade Plugin (as described <a href="http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-shade-plugin/examples/executable-jar.html">here</a>) to your pom.xml allows you to generate a self-contained executable JAR file including all libraries and dependencies.<br />
<br />
"mvn package" to generate the JAR and then "java -jar mypackage.jar" to run. Useful for creating self-contained artifacts for offline distribution or for locking dependency versions.
